Simulations plants. Green cells are plants and brown cells are seeds. 
Uses a DNA inspired system of 'codes' (=instructions) that determine the life of a plant, 
such as buildign another cell or building a seed. 
Random mutations of the 'codes' (delete, insert, change) introduce entropy and fuel the evolution.
